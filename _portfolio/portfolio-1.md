- Summary: 


This chapter covered several methods for fine-tuning pretrained models for specific classification tasks. Key techniques included:

`Standard Fine-Tuning:` Fine-tuning a BERT model, with the option to freeze certain layers to preserve learned representations.

`Few-Shot Classification:` Using a technique called SetFit to achieve high performance on tasks with very limited labeled data.

`Continued Pretraining:` Adapting a pretrained model to new data using its original training objective, masked language modeling.

`Token-Level Classification:` Performing named-entity recognition (NER), which classifies individual words rather than entire documents.
