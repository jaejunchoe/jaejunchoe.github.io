Introduction
======

안녕하세요, 저는 경희대학교 산업경영공학과 지능형에너지융합전공 석사과정에 재학 중에 있습니다. 현재 대학원 석사과정으로 [인공지능 & 경영과학 연구실(Artificial Intelligence & Management Science Lab)](https://sites.google.com/khu.ac.kr/aims/home)에 소속되어있습니다. 저의 관심 연구분야는 `Defect Detection, Anomaly Detection, Data Mining`입니다.


Hello! I am currently pursuing a master’s degree in the Intelligent Energy Convergence program within the Department of Industrial and Management Engineering at Kyung Hee University. I am affiliated with the [Artificial Intelligence & Management Science Lab](https://sites.google.com/khu.ac.kr/aims/home) as a graduate student. My research interests are in `Defect Detection, Anomaly Detection, and Data Mining`.

**Side Projects**
----

**Side Project 4.** Vision Transformer와 유사도 기반 반도체 혼합 결합 유형 예측(Prediction of Mixed Defect Types in Semiconductors Using Vision Transformer and Similarity-Based Methods)
- `Role:` Individual
- `Period:` Individual Project conducted in a Capstone Design Lecture under the supervision of Prof. Young-Sil Lee at Kumoh National Institute of Technology, 1st Semester 2024 , 2023.09 ~ 2023.12

<br/>

- `Contents:` <br/>
1. The goal is to predict dual defect types in data using only single defect data. <br/>
1. Two models based on Vision Transformers and KNN algorithms were designed, using Euclidean and Gaussian distance calculation methods for 
comparative analysis. <br/>
1. Prediction of dual defect types involving 'Edge_Loc' showed higher accuracy than previous studies using CNN, but overall performance was not 
satisfactory.  <br/>


<br/>

🏆**Side Project 3.** EG(Eco Gumi)-Service: 에너지 효율성 및 지속 가능한 에너지 사용을 위한 통합 플랫폼(EG(Eco Gumi)-Service: Integrated Platform for Energy Efficiency and Sustainable Energy Use)
- `Role:` Team Member
- `Period:` Datathon Contest conducted in 2023 Gumi Industrial Complex Energy Self-Sufficiency Datathon, 2023.09 ~ 2023.12
- 🏆`Prize:` Grand Prize,President's Award from Korea Electric Power Corporation(KEPCO), (KRW 4,000,000)

<br/>

- `Contents:` <br/>
1. Developed a service idea(EG-Service). <br/>
1. Analyzing the correlations in hourly usage data to identify past times with high correlation to past power usage and conducting time series clustering on 
the daily usage patterns of power consuming companies. <br/>
1. Utilizing various algorithmic models such as Linear Regression, LSTM, and Ensemble Methods (Voting, Stacking, etc.) to derive R-squared and MAE. <br/>
1. Proposing features for visualizing energy usage and policy notification services, and creating a Service Blueprint and user behavior simulation map to 
refine the service ideas.


<br/>

**Side Project 2.** 서울시의 노인 돌봄 센터 제안과 AI를 활용한 최적의 위치 선정 및 제안(Proposed elder care centers in Seoul and identified optimal locations using AI)
- `Role:` Team Member
- `Period:` Contest conducted in the 2023 Seoul Artificial Intelligence Idea Challenge, 2023.08 ~ 2023.10


- `Contents:` <br/>
1. Proposal for 'Elderly Care Centers' (ECC) and Selection of Optimal Locations Based on Data. <br/>
1. By utilizing data on population and the number of welfare facilities in each region, we conducted clustering to select areas that need to be converted into 
ECC based on the proportional and inversely proportional relationships of the compared data. <br/>
1. Clustering was performed using DBSCAN, and the hyperparameters were derived through GridSearch. <br/>
1. As a result, we identified Nowon-gu, Gangseo-gu, Yangcheon-gu, Songpa-gu, and Seongbuk-gu as areas urgently requiring conversion into ECCs.


<br/>

**Side Project 1.** 2024년 FA(자유계약선수) 자격을 갖춘 KBO 선수들의 연봉 예측(Salary prediction for KBO players eligible for FA (Free Agent) in 2024)
- `Role:` Team Member & Presenter
- `Period:` Term project conducted in the Machine Learning Lecture at Kumoh National Institute of Technology, 1st Semester 2023, 2023.05 ~ 2023.06

- `Contents:` <br/>
1. Collected performance metrics for KBO players who signed FA contracts from 2019 to 2023. <br/>
1. Analyzed the correlation between performance metrics and salaries for pitchers and batters. <br/>
1. Created a model using RandomForestRegressor with performance metrics that had a correlation of 0.5 or higher. 











How to edit your site's GitHub repository
------
Many people use a git client to create files on their local computer and then push them to GitHub's servers. If you are not familiar with git, you can directly edit these configuration and markdown files directly in the github.com interface. Navigate to a file (like [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_talks/2012-03-01-talk-1.md) and click the pencil icon in the top right of the content preview (to the right of the "Raw | Blame | History" buttons). You can delete a file by clicking the trashcan icon to the right of the pencil icon. You can also create new files or upload files by navigating to a directory and clicking the "Create new file" or "Upload files" buttons. 

Example: editing a markdown file for a talk

For more info
------
More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.


Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
