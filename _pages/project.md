1. By presenting a novel approach for structured input fuzzing via Parse-Rate Driven Curriculum Learning, Lightweight EMA-Based Scheduling, and an Automatic Phase Transition Mechanism, we demonstrated suitability for real-time high-throughput fuzzing and achieved synergy between parse-rate phases and coverage monitoring. <br/>
1. Through this approach, we demonstrated superior performance in both code coverage (+4.03%) and execution speed (+6.50%) compared to standard AFL++, significantly enhancing the efficiency of vulnerability analysis for software with complex structures. <br/>

- `Contents:` <br/>
1. As the volume of academic data in science and technology rapidly increases, researchers are facing difficulties in searching for prior studies and classifying content due to the limitations of existing keyword-based search systems. <br/>
1. To address this problem, we propose and implement RAG-FSR (Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Food Science Research), a language model specialized for the food research domain that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology. <br/>
1. The results showed that RAG-FSR achieved an accuracy of 0.960, particularly in the multi-keyword classification task. Furthermore, on the exact-match accuracy metric for abstract generation, our model performed approximately 4-9 times better than the baseline models. <br/>
1. This empirically demonstrates that the proposed model effectively mitigates the hallucination phenomenon common in large language models and can function as a highly accurate and reliable information classification and retrieval system for food science research data. <br/>
