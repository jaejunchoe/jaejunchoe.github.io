1. The goal is to predict dual defect types in data using only single defect data. <br/>
1. Two models based on Vision Transformers and KNN algorithms were designed, using Euclidean and Gaussian distance calculation methods for 
comparative analysis. <br/>
1. Prediction of dual defect types involving 'Edge_Loc' showed higher accuracy than previous studies using CNN, but overall performance was not 
satisfactory.  <br/>

1. Developed a service idea(EG-Service). <br/>
1. Analyzing the correlations in hourly usage data to identify past times with high correlation to past power usage and conducting time series clustering on 
the daily usage patterns of power consuming companies. <br/>
1. Utilizing various algorithmic models such as Linear Regression, LSTM, and Ensemble Methods (Voting, Stacking, etc.) to derive R-squared and MAE. <br/>
1. Proposing features for visualizing energy usage and policy notification services, and creating a Service Blueprint and user behavior simulation map to 
refine the service ideas.

- `Contents:`  <br/>
1. We will establish a “School of Liberal Studies” for undergraduate students to strengthen their convergence capabilities and expand opportunities for major exploration.  <br/>
1. We will improve the course evaluation system to facilitate better communication between students and professors.  <br/>
1. Through initiatives like the “Alumni School Visit Program” and a nationwide high school promotion tour, we will attract outstanding students from other regions.  <br/>
1. Following the example of Duksung Women’s University, we aim to increase students' satisfaction with major selection by offering a major exploration period, while enhancing the university’s global and creative brand value.  <br/>
1. Through these initiatives, we aim to achieve enhanced competitiveness, innovative education, and a stronger university brand for Kumoh National Institute of Technology.

**Side Project 3.** [서울시의 노인 돌봄 센터 제안과 AI를 활용한 최적의 위치 선정 및 제안(Proposed elder care centers in Seoul and identified optimal locations using AI)](https://github.com/jaejunchoe/2023-Seoul-Artificial-Intelligence-Idea-Challenge)
- `Role:` Team Member
- `Period:` Contest conducted in the 2023 Seoul Artificial Intelligence Idea Challenge, 2023.08 ~ 2023.10
- `Contents:` <br/>
1. Proposal for 'Elderly Care Centers' (ECC) and Selection of Optimal Locations Based on Data. <br/>
1. By utilizing data on population and the number of welfare facilities in each region, we conducted clustering to select areas that need to be converted into 
ECC based on the proportional and inversely proportional relationships of the compared data. <br/>
1. Clustering was performed using DBSCAN, and the hyperparameters were derived through GridSearch. <br/>
1. As a result, we identified Nowon-gu, Gangseo-gu, Yangcheon-gu, Songpa-gu, and Seongbuk-gu as areas urgently requiring conversion into ECCs.
