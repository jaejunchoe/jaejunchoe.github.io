  1. We designed a Multi-Agent CRM message generation system utilizing LangGraph to automate the entire process from persona understanding to message creation, addressing the current "content bottleneck" where manual message creation fails to keep pace with rapid targeting capabilities.
  1. We proposed a Persona Analyzer that conducts in-depth analysis of psychological purchase motivations based on 8 core beauty segments, moving beyond simple demographic analysis to understand the customer's context.
  1. We implemented a Product Matcher using a ChromaDB-based RAG pipeline, converting 2,753 original Amorepacific product data points into 516 core product categories to perform semantic matching aligned with the persona's skin concerns and brand information.
  1. By integrating a Message Generator that applies brand-specific tone and manner, and a Quality Checker that validates character limits and predicts CTR, we ensured the generation of high-quality, optimal CRM messages with a robust retry and fallback mechanism.
  1. Through this approach, we expect to significantly improve email open rates (+150~194%) and CTR (+150~192%) while reducing message generation time by over 95%, ultimately maximizing CRM operational efficiency and transforming marketers into strategic designers.

  <div markdown="1">

  1. To resolve the issues of unbalanced utilization rates and parking shortages in Seoul's municipal parking lots, we designed a convex optimization-based dynamic parking recommendation AI agent that allocates the optimal parking lot by reflecting real-time urban data.
  1. We proposed an objective function that simultaneously minimizes parking lot congestion, user travel distance, and parking fees. Additionally, we prevented demand concentration at specific parking lots by applying capacity overflow prevention and an upper bound constraint on congestion ($\rho_{max}$).
  1. We implemented a framework that assigns the optimal parking lot utilizing the CVXPY solver, and integrated a feature where an LLM dynamically recommends hyperparameter weights ($\alpha, \beta, \gamma$) based on real-time situational prompts, such as city festivals or events.
  1. Through this approach, we achieved superior performance across all metrics compared to the conventional Greedy algorithm—including improvements in congestion (+8.2%, +7.5%), parking costs (+4%, +5.8%), and travel distance (+0.2%, +0.8%) for weekdays and weekends, respectively. Furthermore, we demonstrated that this system can effectively alleviate users' parking search time and stress while guaranteeing a global optimal solution.

  1. We implemented Plateau Detection to automatically identify coverage stagnation and integrated optional LLM support to generate diverse initial seeds.
  1. By presenting a novel approach for structured input fuzzing via Parse-Rate Driven Curriculum Learning, Lightweight EMA-Based Scheduling, and an Automatic Phase Transition Mechanism, we demonstrated suitability for real-time high-throughput fuzzing and achieved synergy between parse-rate phases and coverage monitoring.
  1. Through this approach, we demonstrated superior performance in both code coverage (+4.03%) and execution speed (+6.50%) compared to standard AFL++, significantly enhancing the efficiency of vulnerability analysis for software with complex structures.

  1. As the volume of academic data in science and technology rapidly increases, researchers are facing difficulties in searching for prior studies and classifying content due to the limitations of existing keyword-based search systems.
  1. To address this problem, we propose and implement RAG-FSR (Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Food Science Research), a language model specialized for the food research domain that utilizes Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) technology.
  1. The results showed that RAG-FSR achieved an accuracy of 0.960, particularly in the multi-keyword classification task. Furthermore, on the exact-match accuracy metric for abstract generation, our model performed approximately 4-9 times better than the baseline models.
  1. This empirically demonstrates that the proposed model effectively mitigates the hallucination phenomenon common in large language models and can function as a highly accurate and reliable information classification and retrieval system for food science research data.
