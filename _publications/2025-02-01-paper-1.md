# Abstract
Chronic diseases require long-term treatment, with hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes being representative examples. These diseases can be prevented through dietary adjustments and exercise, and once diagnosed, dietary regulation becomes even more essential. However, it is challenging for patients to accurately assess their food intake. This study developed an application to automate the calculation of nutritional components in food to address this issue. The developed application provides efficient analysis with relatively low training costs by using YOLO to detect and distinguish food instead of relying on ingredient recognition methods. Additionally, by utilizing SAM to segment images, the application performs component calculations based on the derived results, allowing users to reference the nutrient content of specific foods and make healthier dietary decisions. The plate recognition accuracy was 95.1%, and the food recognition accuracy was 84.9%, with an error rate of 5.56% observed over 30 trials.
